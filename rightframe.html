            <h2>Association for Computing Machinery</h2>
            <p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a US-based international learned society for computing. It was founded in 1947 and is the world's largest scientific and educational computing society. The ACM is a non-profit professional membership group, reporting nearly 110,000 student and professional members as of 2022. Its headquarters are in New York City. The ACM is an umbrella organization for academic and scholarly interests in computer science (informatics). Its motto is "Advancing Computing as a Science & Profession".</p>
            <p>History</p>
            <p>In 1947, a notice was sent to various people:</p>
            <p>On January 10, 1947, at the Symposium on Large-Scale Digital Calculating Machinery at the Harvard computation Laboratory, Professor Samuel H. Caldwell of Massachusetts Institute of Technology spoke of the need for an association of those interested in computing machinery, and of the need for communication between them. [...] After making some inquiries during May and June, we believe there is ample interest to start an informal association of many of those interested in the new machinery for computing and reasoning. Since there has to be a beginning, we are acting as a temporary committee to start such an association:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>E. C. Berkeley, Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Newark, N. J.</li>
                <li>R. V. D. Campbell, Raytheon Manufacturing Co., Waltham, Mass.</li>
                <li>John H. Curtiss, Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C.</li>
                <li>H. E. Goheen, Office of Naval Research, Boston, Mass.</li>
                <li>J. W. Mauchly, Electronic Control Co., Philadelphia, Pa.</li>
                <li>T. K. Sharpless, Moore School of Elec. Eng., Philadelphia, Pa.</li>
                <li>R. Taylor, Mass. Inst. of Tech., Cambridge, Mass.</li>
                <li>C. B. Tompkins, Engineering Research Associates, Washington, D.C.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The committee (except for Curtiss) had gained experience with computers during World War II: Berkeley, Campbell, and Goheen helped build Harvard Mark I under Howard H. Aiken, Mauchly and Sharpless were involved in building ENIAC, Tompkins had used "the secret Navy code-breaking machines", and Taylor had worked on Bush's Differential analyzers.</p>
            <p>The ACM was then founded in 1947 under the name Eastern Association for Computing Machinery, which was changed the following year to the Association for Computing Machinery. The ACM History Committee since 2016 has published the A.M. Turing Oral History project, the ACM Key Award Winners Video Series, and the India Industry Leaders Video project.</p>
